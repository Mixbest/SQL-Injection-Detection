1.	INTRODUCTION

SQL Injection Detection is an innovative way that aims to revolutionize the security breach of website, identify the unauthorized access in website.
The website offers a user-friendly interface that allows users and buyers to connect directly, identify the unauthorized user and check the SQL injection.
SQL Injection (SQLi) is one of the most common and severe vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to manipulate or gain unauthorized access to these databases.
The SQL Injection Detection project focuses on identifying and mitigating SQLi vulnerabilities in web applications. By implementing automated detection mechanisms, this project aims to safeguard applications from potential attacks, ensuring a secure environment for users and data.
1.1.	OBJECTIVE

To develop a mechanism to recognize common patterns and behaviours associated with SQL Injection attacks, such as unexpected query structures, special character usage, or abnormal input formats. 
To protect the underlying database by identifying and rejecting malicious queries                                              could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or deletion.
To implement Implement a system that can detect SQLi attempts in real-time and alert administrators to take immediate action, minimizing potential damage.
To Integrate the SQL Injection Detection mechanism into web applications to provide an additional layer of security, ensuring data confidentiality and user trust.
To highlight the risks associated with SQL Injection attacks and demonstrate the importance of adopting secure coding practices and defensive mechanisms in software development.

1.2.	NEED OF THE PROJECT

Web applications play a critical role in managing sensitive information such as personal data, financial records, and business operations. With the increasing reliance on these systems, the security of underlying databases has become paramount.
This project addresses these needs by developing a reliable and scalable SQL Injection Detection mechanism that enhances the security posture of web applications, protects sensitive data, and ensures a safer digital environment.
Many developers and organizations still underestimate the risk of SQL Injection attacks or fail to implement robust security measures. This project highlights the importance of proactive detection and prevention mechanisms.
To Prevalence of SQL Injection Attacks, resulting in data breaches, unauthorized                     Accesses.
2.	FEASABILITY STUDY
A feasibility study for the Fleurissant ecommerce website evaluates the platformâ€™s potential for success by analyzing its technical, operational, and financial viability.
Fleurissant aims to revolutionize the way people to buy flowers by providing a user friendly online platform. Our main purpose to detect the SQL injection in website.

Technical Feasibility
 Evaluate platforms scalability and performance under high traffic. Assess integration with scanning gateways, shipping services and inventory management systems. Design a platform to scale with increasing traffic and sales.

Operational Feasibility
Establish relationships with local farmers and suppliers. Plan the logistics of order fulfilment, shipping, scanning SQL injection presence and customer services.
Examine the system ability to handle order processing, customer support and marketing tools. Check the whole users security.
Economic Feasibility
Determine the point at which the project  will become profitable. Estimate the costs involved in developing and maintaining the website, including development, hosting, marketing, and operational costs.

2.1 PURPOSE
The main purpose of the project is to create a website that and check the presence of SQL Injection in the website. And check the accessibility of the user, that user is authentic user or not a attacker. This is used to check the web application durability and security.

2.2SCOPE
This product has great future scope.  Provides a platform for flower buyers to buy the product according to their choice.
It also provides security with the use of Login-id and Password, so that any unauthorized users can not use your account. The only authorized person can get the access to your account on this site.

7.	Future Scope

The following things can be done in future.
The current system can be extended to allow the users to sell their products. 
The users could subscribe for price alerts which would enable them to receive messages when price for products fall below a particular level. 
Users can have multiple shipping and billing information saved. During checkout they can use the drag and drop feature to select shipping and billing information.
The accessibility and security is accessed by the admin and also keep the data of user secured.
Escape the website from attackers and SQL injections into the database.

8.	Conclusion

The â€˜Fleurissantâ€™ is designed to provide a web based application that would make Searching, viewing and selection of a farming related product easier. It will help farmers from the Indian villages to buy the products from various city markets directly to customers without the help of intermediaries or agents. Thus, it will helpful to bring an ease in the life of a farmer while buying products for farming. Here we scan all details of the users. That details are authentic or not .We defend our website from SQL injection.
